    RATE LIMITER: RoleBasedRateLimiterPolicy
    ===========================================================

    [1] THE CONCEPT: "PARTITIONING"
    -----------------------------------------------------------
    Think of a "Partition" as a bucket. 
    - If the Bucket Name = "Sellers", then 100 sellers are all 
    throwing their requests into the SAME bucket. If one 
    seller is fast, they empty the bucket for everyone else.
    - If the Bucket Name = "Seller:10", then ONLY User 10 uses 
    that bucket.

    STRATEGY: We combine {Role} and {UserId} so that we can 
    give different roles different "bucket sizes," but keep 
    the buckets private to each individual user.

    [2] THE LIMITS EXPLAINED
    -----------------------------------------------------------
    * ADMIN (Concurrency - 10)
    - Unlike a timer, this counts "Right now." 
    - An admin can have 10 tabs open doing heavy tasks. 
    - The 11th request is blocked until one of the 10 finishes.

    * SELLER (Fixed Window - 300 per Minute)
    - Standard frequency check. 
    - Good for dashboard users who click around frequently.

    * CUSTOMER (Fixed Window - 200 per Minute)
    - Allows 200 hits, but resets every single minute. 

    * ANONYMOUS (Fixed Window - 100 per Minute)
    - Identify by: IP Address.
    - Prevents random scripts from hitting your login/register 
        endpoints too hard.

    [3] KEY BEHAVIORS
    -----------------------------------------------------------
    - REJECTION: If a user hits the limit, they get a 429 error.
    - NO QUEUE: We set QueueLimit = 0. This means we don't make 
    users "wait in line." We just say "No" immediately. 
    This saves your server's RAM.
    - RECOVERY: As soon as the Window (1 min or 1 sec) passes, 
    the bucket refills automatically.

    [4] IMPLEMENTATION RECAP
    -----------------------------------------------------------
    1. Extract Role/ID from User Claims.
    2. If not logged in, use "Anonymous" + IP Address.
    3. Build the string: "Seller:123".
    4. Pass that string to the Limiter.
