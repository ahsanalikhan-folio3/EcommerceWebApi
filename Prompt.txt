You now have complete context about the entire project (codebase, folder structure, Dtos, services, controllers, entities, authentication/authorization setup, database context, error handling patterns, etc.).

Your task is to write a **brief but comprehensive project documentation** (aim for 1200–2200 words) that serves as a single, high-level yet detailed overview of the whole application for developers, maintainers, new team members, or technical stakeholders.

Use clear, professional language. Structure the document using Markdown with the following mandatory sections (do not skip or rename them):

1. **Project Overview**  
   - One-paragraph high-level summary  
   - Main purpose / business domain  
   - Target users (buyers, sellers, admin)  
   - Key high-level features

2. **Technology Stack & Major Choices**  
   - Backend: ASP.NET Core version, Web API  
   - SQL Server and EF Core 
   - Authentication & Authorization mechanism  
   - Other important libraries / patterns (AutoMapper, FluentValidation, SignalR, HangFire etc.)  
   - Architectural style (Clean Architecture)

3. **Project Structure (Folder / Solution Layout)**  
   - Explain the most important projects / folders and their responsibilities  
   - Example:  
     - EcommerceApp.Domain  
     - EcommerceApp.Application  
     - EcommerceApp.Infrastructure  
     - EcommerceApp.API
   - Why this structure was chosen

4. **Core Domain Entities & Relationships**  
   - List and very briefly describe the main entities (Products, Orders, SellerOrders, ApplicationUsers, SellerProfiles, CustomerProfiles, AdminProfiles, Chats, Messages, Feedbacks etc.)  
   - Important relationships (1-to-many, many-to-many)  
   - Any notable domain rules or invariants

5. **Key Features & Implementation Highlights**  
   Break down into 5–8 major functional areas. For each:  
   - Short description  
   - Main endpoint(s) / use-case(s)  
   - Important business logic location (which service/handler)  
   - Any special implementation detail (e.g. soft delete, optimistic concurrency, caching, file upload, email notifications, etc.)

   Examples of areas to cover (adapt to the real project):  
   - Product catalog & search  
   - Seller dashboard & product management  
   - Shopping cart & checkout flow  
   - Order placement & order history  
   - Seller order management (accept/reject/ship)  
   - User authentication & roles  
   - Reviews & ratings

6. **Security & Authorization**  
   - How users are authenticated  
   - Role-based vs policy-based authorization  
   - Which endpoints are protected and how  
   - Any seller-specific authorization logic

7. **Data Access & Persistence**  
   - Database type & provider  
   - EF Core configuration highlights (owned types, global query filters, interceptors, etc.)  
   - Repository pattern? Unit of Work? Direct DbContext usage?

8. **Error Handling & Validation**  
   - Global exception handling strategy  
   - Validation approach (FluentValidation, Data Annotations, manual)  
   - Typical response shape for errors (like the one with "success", "message", "errors")

9. **Current Limitations & Known Technical Debt**  
   - Honestly list 4–8 important missing/completed-partially things  
   - Planned / desirable improvements (if any known)

10. **Getting Started / Setup Instructions** (brief)  
    - Prerequisites  
    - How to run locally (database, migrations, seed data, launch settings)  
    - Important environment variables / appsettings keys

**Tone & Style Guidelines**  
- Be concise but specific — avoid vague statements like "we used good architecture".  
- Use code blocks for short illustrative snippets (folder names, example DTOs, endpoint signatures) when it adds clarity.  
- Do **not** paste huge code blocks — only 5–12 lines max per snippet.  
- Write in third person ("The system implements…", "Orders are managed via…").  
- Assume the reader knows C# / .NET but is new to **this** project.
